- Package for various Linux OSes (Debian, Fedora, etc)

I'm trying to work out a portable way to properly drop all but the needed
privileges (in Linux, that's CAP_NET_RAW).  However, I can't find a good piece
of code that shows how to drop privileges besides resetting the user IDs.

A program with "added safety" would detect Linux and drop all privileges except
CAP_NET_RAW, then maintain the privilege through a dropping of root privileges.
I just haven't done it yet.

As it is, I believe there are sufficient checks and balances on the program so
as to permit setuid use.
